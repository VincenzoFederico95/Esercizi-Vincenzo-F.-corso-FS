//# Optional Chaining In this example we are trying to check if a value for the `city` property is defined. However, the code can be simplified. How can we do that?

const order = {
    customer: {
      address: {
    city:{Palermo}
      },
    },
  };
  
  
  
  let doescityexist = order.customer.address?.city;
  if(!doescityexist){
    console.log ("City is required!");}
    else{
      console.log("Registered Successfully!")
    }
